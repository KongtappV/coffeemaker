Directory Structure
-------------------
 * `build.gradle` -- the build file that will help you build the SUT and tests as well as execute the tests and measure coverage
 * `gradlew` -- script to run gradle from a *NIX system
 * `gradlew.bat` -- script to run gradle from Windows
 * `Requirements-CoffeeMaker.pdf` -- the requirements 
 * `ClassDiagram-CoffeeMaker.pdf` -- the class diagram of the coffee maker software
 * `SequenceDiagram-CoffeeMaker.pdf` -- the sequence diagram (describes the interactions among the objects) of the coffee maker software
 * `src/main/java` -- contains the system under test (SUT; in this case, the coffee maker code) and all of its dependencies.  Do not modify any of this code.
   - `edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker.*` -- the code for the system under test (the coffee maker)
 * `src/test/java` -- the test code
   - `edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker.CoffeeMakerTest` -- the JUnit tests for the `CoffeeMaker` class.  You will need to update this file.
 * `build/reports` -- contains the different reports generated by the build.  NOTE: This directory will only exist once a gradle build has been run!
   - `tests/test/index.html` -- the JUnit test report (describing which tests passed and which failed); this file is only created if the unit tests are executed.
